# Arch Vanilla Installation

Note: Make sure you go through the preparation section before making a new installation of Arch. This guide is more based on this following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxeriGuJKTM) than the [arch guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide).

By now you have done the first 4 steps in the [Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide). We will not be following this in order, instead it will be in my own prefered order.
