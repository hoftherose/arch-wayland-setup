# Setup your computer

General recommendations for setting up your system once installed. Based off of [arch guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/General_recommendations).

## Getting internet (again)

Connect to the internet using nmcli (assuming you installed networkmanager). If not simply reboot and mount from the live-usb and install anything that you may have been missing. Follow the [guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager#Usage) to know how to use nmcli to connect to the internet.
