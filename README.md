# Arch DWM Setup

[TOC]

## What is it.

This repo is a collection of setup instructions for my computer. It contains instructions for installation, applications, gaming and cloud configuration and even aestetics/shortcuts. Sum of the files are really simple and can even be automated, while others require a careful step-by-step explaination, to avoid future breakage on automated scripts. This is the second OS setup guide and it is for Arch which I hope to use more after setting up my computer correctly. I never ended up making a separate DE guide so this will double as a DWM tiling manager guide. There will be RICE.

## Preparation

Simple and optional preparation steps to make the process faster. This includes copying the firefox profile to avoid having to configure a new one.

## Installation

The installation section is mostly just how to successfully install arch into your system. This isn't for the faint of heart and will mostly just be "Follow the Manual". For computers without dedicated GPU's it should be as easy as that. Still you will need a clean usb and a bootable usb utility tool (rufus or etcher are both good).

## Standard Setup

Once Arch is installed there are a few commands you should run to make sure that your system is ready for use. Although there are some preferences in this section, most of the steps are my widely recommended requirements for an arch system.

## Applications

List of applications that are recommended for normal workflow. All gaming applications are left out and can be found in the Gaming Section. Most of the tooling will be minimalist and vary quite a bit compared to the Manjaro Guide. There will be a focus on neovim centered development and tooling but this will be further expanded on in the Programming section.

-   Firefox
-   Spotify
-   Steam

## Gaming

IN PROGRESS: This is probably going to require a bit more expermientation as I don't know how the current state of linux gaming is at the moment. I hope to atleast get some steam games setup quickly and posibly allow GPU use.

## Programming

Preparing VSCode and terminal for different coding tasks. Has a setup section for general programming and a task specific section for current projects.

-   Setup
-   Cloud Dev
-   Web-Dev

## Aestetics

Currently where I'm going to keep my DWM configuration instructions. RICE. There maybe more than one setup depending on how much time I dedicate on this.

## Shortcuts

Between neovim and zsh, as well as DWM in general there will more than likely be quite a few shortcuts, these will be stored in configuration files and can be found here for reference.
