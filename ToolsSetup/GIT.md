# Setup git on your new computer

You should already have git installed, which means that there won't be any need for that. But if for what ever case you don't just install through 
`pacman -Syu git`. Most of the steps here will be about setting up your config, ssh connections and ssh keys to online repos (github, gitlab and bitbucket).
