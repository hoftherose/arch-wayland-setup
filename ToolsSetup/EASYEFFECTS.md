# Setup easy effects on your new computer

To setup easy effects you need to have the following packages installed:

easyeffects             # Library for adding effects to pipewire applications
lsp-plugins             # Linux studio plugins for multiple effect integrations
libdeep_filter_ladspa   # deep filter net installation

Once these are setup, simply set preferences to "auto add" for input, that should make it so any new recording devices or applications will automatically have your effects installed onto them.
