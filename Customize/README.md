# Customization
Here we will customize our setup, meaning that this is probably the part that you should follow the least as it is purely opinionated.

## Setting Grub Theme
To create a theme for your grub you must first download the theme then set the grub configuration to use that theme. Below will be an example of how to set this up using [SiriusAhu/Persona_5_Royal_Grub_Themes](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/2122684).

First download and extract the tar.gz release file:
```
wget -c https://github.com/SiriusAhu/Persona_5_Royal_Grub_Themes/releases/download/v1.0/joker.tar.gz -P /boot/grub/themes
tar -xvzf /boot/grub/themes/joker.tar.gz -C /boot/grub/themes --no-same-owner
```

Now we just set the value for `GRUB_THEME` in `/etc/default/grub` to the path we just used. `/boot/grub/themes/joker/theme.txt` Make sure to uncomment the line and run `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg` like before. Once done simply reboot.

## Customize pacman
### Ilovecandy
To make the pacman appear on downloads add the line `ILoveCandy` right below `# Misc Options`

## Graphics and WM/DE
These are the GUI enabling libraries to get out of the terminal prison. We will be installing `wayland` although you could also use xorg which is older and more stable. For our window manager we will use `hyprland`. This will use the following [repo](https://github.com/SolDoesTech/HyprV4) for setting up hyprland quickly, but we will not use the script, instead we will be installing the tools as we go and only when needed.

### Install Hyprland
We are going to install 3 things here real quick: hyprland, kitty and gtk3. hyprland will be our DE, which will install and use wayland, kitty is the default terminal software. gtk3 will be needed in order to open kitty on hyprland. Once you are done you can run `Hyprland`.

```
sudo pacman -S hyprland kitty gtk3
Hyprland
```

You should get a simple page with a warning message on how to open kitty and exit hyprland. Using super+q open kitty so you can edit the `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` file. Set the following values in their respective variables objects this will be our initial hyprland config for getting started.

```
autogenerated = 0
...
general {
    gaps_in = 2
    gaps_in = 5

    border_size = 3
    ...
}

decoration {
    rounding = 3
    ...
}
```
